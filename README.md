# PetriNetsAndroid
A puzzle game about petri nets. If you want to use the code, ask please.

This game is made with Unity3D and intended for fun, not for teaching (though it might very well be a side effect). Level Design works entirely without code. If you want to contribute, I'd happily help you set up the dev environment (it's easy) and give you a few pointers.
